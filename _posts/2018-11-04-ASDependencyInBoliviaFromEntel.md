Traceroute from a machine located inside the Entel autonomous system (6568) to the first possible IPv4 address of every prefix assigned to a Bolivian entity (ie. `traceroute 45.4.98.1` for the prefix "45.4.98.0/23"), measured on 4 Nov 2018 (see the [20181103_dependencias_as_bolivia code repository](https://framagit.org/severo/20181103_dependencias_as_bolivia) to create data from another viewpoint). The code used to realize the measurements is available in a [public repository](https://framagit.org/severo/20181103_dependencias_as_bolivia).
